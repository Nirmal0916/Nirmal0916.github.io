	You are the most wonderful friend, I ever got in my entire life. You are like a big brother to me but this doesn't mean that I will call you "dai" or "dada". Jokes apart, let me wish you a happy birthday and many many happy returns of the day. I know god will bless you cause you are my friend and you, try to live a happy life. I only know this wishes but I would like to tell you that your small impact have changed my thinking and even life for good. And thank you for that.Be happy! Today is the day you were brought into this world to be a blessing and inspiration to the people around you! You are a wonderful person! May you be given more birthdays to fulfill all of your dreams!”. Also don't forget that you have a friend who can help you in times of need. A friend like you is more priceless than the most beautiful diamond. You are not only strong and wise, but kind and thoughtful as well. Your birthday is the perfect opportunity to show you how much I care and how grateful I am to have you in my life. Happy birthday!” And just try to ignore if you don't like the design cause you know your friend is not good at it.
